### How to Run Streamlit Code

Running Streamlit code is straightforward. First, ensure Streamlit is installed in your Python environment:

Install Streamlit via pip:
``` pip install streamlit``` 
Create your Streamlit script,  for example we will call it ``` app.py``` , and add your code.

``` streamlit run app.py``` 
Your default browser will automatically open a new tab directed to your local server, where your Streamlit app is running.

### How to Create an OpenAI API Key and Best Practices for Management

Creating an OpenAI API key is your entry point to leveraging the powerful capabilities of OpenAI's models, including GPT-3, Codex, and DALLÂ·E. Here's a step-by-step guide to obtaining your key and best practices for managing it securely.

#### Creating an OpenAI API Key

1. **Sign Up or Log In**: First, you need to have an OpenAI account. Go to the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) page and sign up or log in if you already have an account.

2. **API Access**: Once logged in, navigate to the API section where you can manage your API keys.

3. **Generate API Key**: Look for an option to generate a new API key. This is usually a button or link labeled "New API Key" or "Create API Key."

4. **Key Details**: When creating a key, you might be prompted to provide details such as a name or description for the key. Use something descriptive to help you identify the key's purpose later.

5. **Save Your Key**: Once the key is generated, make sure to copy and securely save the API key. It won't be shown again for security reasons.

## Best Practices for API Key Management

#### Storing API Keys

- **Environment Variables**: Store your API keys in environment variables. This keeps the keys out of your source code and makes them easier to manage, especially across different development and production environments.

- **.env Files**: For local development, you can use `.env` files to define environment variables. Make sure `.env` is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### Using the API Key

To use the API key in your application, you can load it from the environment variable:

```python
import os

openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
