# Cloud Data Lake Cost Optimization on AWS

Optimizing costs in the cloud is critical for managing scalable and efficient data lakes. AWS provides various resources and tools designed to help users effectively manage and reduce their costs. This markdown page outlines key AWS resources, including guides, dashboards, and whitepapers focused on cost optimization strategies, as well as AWS tools for reporting and cost optimization.

## AWS Resources

### Guides

- **[Ramp-Up Guide: Cost Management] https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/ramp-up_guides/Ramp-Up_Guide_Cost_Management.pdf**

### Dashboards 

In the above guides it highlight the below dashboards for cost monitoring

- **Cloud Intelligence Dashboard**: An interactive, customizable QuickSight dashboard for foundational Cost Management and Optimization reporting. 
  - [Level 200: Cloud Intelligence Dashboards] https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/cloud-intelligence-dashboards/

- **Cost Intelligence Dashboard (CID)**: A customizable dashboard for the foundation of cost management and optimization.

- **CUDOS Dashboard**: Provides in-depth, granular insights and recommendations for diving deep into cost and usage.

- **Trusted Advisor Organizational (TAO) Dashboard**: Helps optimize AWS infrastructure, improve security and performance, reduce costs, and monitor service limits with an organizational view.

- **Additional Dashboards**:
  - Data Transfer Dashboard
  - Trends Dashboard

### Cost Optimization Whitepaper
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/welcome.html
This whitepaper highlights the Cost Optimization Pillars, including strategies like right-sizing, increasing elasticity, leveraging the right pricing model, optimizing storage, and continuous measurement, monitoring, and improvement.

- **Key Pillars**:
  - **Right Size**: Provision resources to match needs accurately.
  - **Increase Elasticity**: Optimize costs for dynamic needs and turn off resources when not needed.
  - **Leverage the Right Pricing Model**: Use On-Demand, Spot, and Reserved Instances based on workload nature.
  - **Optimize Storage**: Reduce costs by selecting appropriate storage tiers for data.
  - **Measure, Monitor, and Improve**: Use cost allocation tagging, define metrics, and assign optimization responsibilities.

- **Tagging**: Utilize tagging for environment organization and accountability.

## Cost consideration to lower Total cost of Ownership (TCO)
In this blog  https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/tco-cost-optimization-best-practices-for-managing-usage/
highlighted some missteps that customers can make that drives up their cloud spent :
•	Orphaned resources
•	Misconfigured storage resources
•	Over-provisioned resources
•	Incorrect pricing plans
•	Overlooking newer technologies
By avoid missteps and leverage cost optimized principles along with using out-of-the-box cost management tools it will greatly help you to reduce your PTO

## AWS Tools for Reporting and Cost Optimization

- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Analyze spending patterns, project future costs, and get recommendations.
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Identify potential areas for optimization in real-time.
- **AWS Budgets**: Set custom budgets to monitor and manage costs.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Track metrics, monitor log files, and set alarms for AWS resources.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Monitor and retain account activity related to AWS infrastructure.
- **Amazon S3 Analytics**: Analyze and visualize Amazon S3 storage patterns.
